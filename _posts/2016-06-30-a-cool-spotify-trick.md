description: A cool spotify trick to get a premium feature, for free!
---

Hello!

Yesterday I found a small cool caveat in the Spotify software I'm very sure most of you already know. In a few words, Spotify is an audio streaming service where you can access most of the music publicly released in the world. There are two different *unilimited* plans: Free and Premium - the difference between the former and the latter are the following:

The following trick relates on **how to play songs on-demand from mobile with the free version**. You will need a computer, a spotify account, and a smartphone with internet connection.

<h1 style="color:black !important">Steps:</h1>

**1)** Open Spotify on your computer

**2)** Go on your phone and start playing one song (whichever it lets you, it doesn't matter)

**3)** Then make the song play on your PC using the small button on the song's screen saying "Available Devices", and then selecting your computer

**4)** Now you'll have the on-request song picking on your phone -- however we're not done yet, as the songs you pick will play through your computer and not through your phone (which is what we want).

**5)** Select the song you want to play from your phone.

**6)** Change the available devices part back to your phone and not your PC, and you are ready to go!

Enjoy!
